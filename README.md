Setup
1. Install CLI:  pip3 install cloudformation-cli cloudformation-cli-python-plugin
2. Configure AWS CLI with your credentials:
$ aws configure

3. Permissions needed:
      -register-type
      -list-types
      -deregister-type
      -set-type-configuration

4. Generate the hook. The cloudformation-cli will create empty handler functions. Each handler created corresponds to a hook invocation point. :  $cfn generate

5. Copy the code from repo in handler.py which is located in the src/ directory.

6. Register the hook: $ cfn submit â€“set-default

7. Check if you can see your hook in the list after you run the command below:
$ aws cloudformation list-types

8.  Copy the hook arn from the response.

9.  Activate hooks from the public registry:
aws cloudformation --region ap-southeast-2 set-type-configuration \
  --configuration "{\"CloudFormationConfiguration\":{\"HookConfiguration\":{\"TargetStacks\":\"ALL\",\"FailureMode\":\"FAIL\",\"Properties\":{}}}}" \
  --type-arn $Hook_ARN
